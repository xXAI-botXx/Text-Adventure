1. Write an epic or boring Story AND make sure to keep the standarts (see below).

2. Add this txt-file to the Stories folder.

3. Write an Issue. There you should say that you have add an nice story and i can implement your story.







The Form of a Story:
(-> First write a txt-file)
-title

-state  keys: 
-text of the state (the text which read from the player)

-state  keys:
-text of state

...

Explanation:
The State defines the point of the Story and is importend for the programming. If you have a branch of the story, the state should call the same with a V1,2,... for version. But you dont have to do this so.
The Keys are the keywords for the desicions.

-> If this wasnt a good describtion (maybe because of my bad english), you should see the written stories in the folder. There you can learn from the practise.
